      <h1>grahamBot</h1>
      <h2>July 2020 - September 2020</h2>
      <p>I developed grahamBot because checking to see if a stock passed basic quality tests, like say, a 33% increase
        in
        earnings over the last 10 years, was getting old fast. I needed a way to filter out the proverbial wheat
        from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>grahamBot allows you to quickly check if a stock (or an excel list of stock names) is worth researching more
        extensively. To do this, it extracts stock information from the internet (also known as web scraping) and
        uses 12 algorithms based on the recommendations outlined in the classic value investing text <i>The Intelligent
          Investor</i> by Benjamin Graham (mentor of Warren Buffet).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end grahamBot presents a report detailing the results of the tests, as well as the
        names of any stocks that passed all the tests.

      <h1>University of Delaware</h1>
      <h2>B.S. in Computer Science, <i>graduating May 2023</i></h2>
      <h3>Newark, DE</h3>
      <p>Through my coursework at UD so far, I've learned the basics of
        Python, C, Java, and C++. But more importantly, UD has taught me
        to learn "better".
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of the classroom, my experiences with the
        <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/usc/bhlp/">Blue Hen Leadership Program</a> has taught me the importance of
        taking action when its easier to conform, and continues to show me the power of
        uplifting others. My engagement with the Entrepreneurship Club exercises my
        communication skills with many opportunities to speak to large audiences, as well
        as network with other ambitious persons from around campus. My time with the UD
        Figure Skating Team has strengthened my work ethic and out of all my escapades
        at UD, brings me out of my comfort zone the most.

      <h2>Founder & CEO, <i>since Fall 2018</i></h2>
      <h3>Hockessin, DE</h3>
      <p>Grasping for an opportunity to enter the world of entrepreneurship, I happened to
        overhear a conversation in my homeroom of high school. Our grade needed a new supplier
        for its t-shirts at the upcoming pep rally. Equipped with a nugget of knowledge
        on the t-shirt printing process and a contact (who I thought was in the industry),
        I decided I was ripe for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little did I know that I would instead end up printing a different class's shirts, and
        eventually be responsible for the printing of ~300 shirts throughout the next year. In
        that year I would learn the ins and outs of the screen printing process, and develop
        a reputation for simple, inexpensive custom t-shirts.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the company continues to target the high school, collegiate, local markets, the
        pandemic has led me to believe a pivot and rebranding of the company is needed in the
        direction of a more premium, upscale online presence. This change is currently underway.

      <h2>Class of 2019</h2>
      <h3>Wilmington, DE</h3>
      <p>I'm grateful for these four developmental years. CSW was where I took my first steps
        towards leadership as the director of the school's fitness club, won a state championship
        with the swim team, fell in love with history, played the piano at a fancy Delaware
        Charter Schools Network award ceremony, tried out four different sports,
        and mentored students passionate about social change at a local nonprofit. And crucially,
        it was at CSW where I had a very forgiving network of teachers, who could see past the
        inevitable mistakes and failures that come along with youth.
